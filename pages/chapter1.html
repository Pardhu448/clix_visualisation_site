             <p>Computer science is a tremendously broad academic discipline. The areas of
                globally distributed systems, artificial intelligence, robotics, graphics,
                security, scientific computing, computer architecture, and dozens of emerging
   		sub-fields all expand with new techniques and discoveries every year. The
		rapid progress of computer science has left few aspects of human life
		unaffected. Commerce, communication, science, art, leisure, and politics have
		all been reinvented as computational domains.</p>

		<p>The high productivity of computer science is only possible because the
		discipline is built upon an elegant and powerful set of fundamental ideas. All
		computing begins with representing information, specifying logic to process it,
		and designing abstractions that manage the complexity of that logic. Mastering
		these fundamentals will require us to understand precisely how computers
		interpret computer programs and carry out computational processes.</p>
		
		<p>These fundamental ideas have long been taught using the classic textbook
		<em>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</em> (<a class="reference external" href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp">SICP</a>) by Harold
		Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman with Julie Sussman. This text borrows
		heavily from that textbook, which the original authors have kindly licensed for
		adaptation and reuse. These notes are also in the public domain, released under

   	   	       <p>In order to define computational processes, we need a programming language;
	   		  preferably one that many humans and a great variety of computers can all
	   		  understand. In this text, we will work primarily with 
			  the <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/py3k/">Python</a> language.</p>
	   		  
	   		  <p>Python is a widely used programming language that has recruited enthusiasts from
	   		  many professions: web programmers, game engineers, scientists, academics, and
	   		  even designers of new programming languages. When you learn Python, you join a
	   		  million-person-strong community of developers. Developer communities are
	   		  tremendously important institutions: members help each other solve problems,
	   		  share their projects and experiences, and collectively develop software and
	   		  tools.  Dedicated members often achieve celebrity and widespread esteem for
	   		  their contributions.</p>
	   		  
	   		  <p>The Python language itself is the product of a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/psf/members/">large volunteer community</a> that prides itself on the <a class="reference external" href="http://python.org/community/diversity/">diversity</a> of its contributors. The language
	   		  was conceived and first implemented by <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum">Guido van Rossum</a> in the late 1980's.
	   		  The first chapter of his <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/py3k/tutorial/appetite.html">Python 3 Tutorial</a> explains why Python is so
	   		  popular, among the many languages available today.</p>
	   		  <p>Python excels as an instructional language because, throughout its history,
	   		  Python's developers have emphasized the human interpretability of Python code,
	   		  reinforced by the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/">Zen of Python</a> guiding principles of beauty, simplicity, and
	   		  readability. Python is particularly appropriate for this text because its broad
	   		  set of features support a variety of different programming styles, which we will
	   		  explore. While there is no single way to program in Python, there are a set of
	   		  conventions shared across the developer community that facilitate reading,
	   		  understanding, and extending existing programs. Python's combination of great
	   		  flexibility and accessibility allows students to explore many programming
	   		  paradigms, and then apply their newly acquired knowledge to thousands of
	   		  <a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi">ongoing projects</a>.</p>
	   		  <p>These notes maintain the spirit of <a class="reference external" href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp">SICP</a> by introducing the features of Python
	   		  in step with techniques for abstraction and a rigorous model of computation. In
	   		  addition, these notes provide a practical introduction to Python programming,
	   		  including some advanced language features and illustrative examples. Increasing
	   		  your facility Python should come naturally as you progress through the text.</p>
	   		  <p>The best way to get started programming in Python is to interact with the
	   		  interpreter directly. This section describes how to install Python 3, initiate
	   		  an interactive session with the interpreter, and start programming.</p>
